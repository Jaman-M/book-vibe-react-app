# Book Vibe

A book management web application built with React, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. This app allows users to view, sort, and mark books as read. It also keeps track of books that have been read using localStorage. Fake book data is loaded initially to simulate the functionality.

## Fake Data

You can simulate the user experience without needing an actual backend. The data is pre-loaded and displayed on the homepage.

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **DaisyUI**: A plugin for Tailwind CSS to add ready-made components.
- **React Router DOM**: For routing and nested routes within the app.
- **LocalStorage**: For saving books marked as "read" on the client side.
